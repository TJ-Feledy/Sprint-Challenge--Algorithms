#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n)
- 'a' is multiplied by 'n * n' which cancels out with the 'n * n * n' to give the runtime of O(n).


b)  O(n*log(n)))
- the 'for' loop has a run time of O(n), and the nested 'while' loop has a runtime of O(log(n)) which when multiplied == O(n*log(n)))


c)  O(n) or O(bunnies)
- I believe the time complexity on this one is O(n) because the recursive function call steps 'n' down by 1 each call.  So it will only run 'n' times.
